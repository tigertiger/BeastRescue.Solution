## Documentation and Routes

### Swagger

_This project includes [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). Per [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/), "Swagger is an open-source standardized and language-agnostic interface for designing and documenting REST APIs. It can be used to design APIs before theyâ€™re built or to document APIs after the code has already been implemented." [see citation](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/building-an-api/further-exploration-with-apis)_
_To access Swagger Documentation for API calls for GET, PATCH, and POST:_
 - Run the application from ```BeastRescue.Solution/BeastRescue``` in your command line
 - Once the application is running, go to `http://localhost:5000`
  -- You can also follow this link while the program is running [Swagger](http://localhost:5000).
